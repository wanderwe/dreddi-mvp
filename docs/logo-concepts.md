# Dreddi Logo Concepts (Quick Visuals)

These are lightweight, monochrome SVG sketches for the five directions discussed.
They are intentionally minimal so they scale well as icons, favicons, and badges.

## How to view

Some Git clients (including GitHub mobile/PR views) do not render SVG images inline in Markdown.
Use one of the options below:

1. Open the preview page locally (no Python required):
   - in PowerShell, first go to the repo root (example): `cd C:\\projects\\dreddi-mvp`
   - run `npx --yes http-server .\\docs -p 8000`
   - open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/logo-concepts-preview.html`
   - if you see a directory listing, click `logo-concepts-preview.html`
2. Open any SVG file directly in the repo:
   - `docs/logo-concepts/confirmed-node.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/agreement-fold.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/outcome-mark.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/dual-trace.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/anchor-frame.svg`
