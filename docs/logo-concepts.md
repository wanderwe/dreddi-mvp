# Dreddi Logo Concepts (Quick Visuals)

These are lightweight, monochrome SVG sketches for the five directions discussed.
They are intentionally minimal so they scale well as icons, favicons, and badges.

## How to view

Some Git clients (including GitHub mobile/PR views) do not render SVG images inline in Markdown.
Use one of the options below:

1. Open the preview page locally (no Python required):
   - `npx --yes http-server docs -p 8000`
   - visit `http://localhost:8000/` (auto-redirects to the preview)
2. Open any SVG file directly in the repo:
   - `docs/logo-concepts/confirmed-node.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/agreement-fold.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/outcome-mark.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/dual-trace.svg`
   - `docs/logo-concepts/anchor-frame.svg`

| Concept | Visual | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confirmed Node | ![Confirmed Node](./logo-concepts/confirmed-node.svg) | Dot-in-ring signal with a small gap to imply a recorded mark. |
| Agreement Fold | ![Agreement Fold](./logo-concepts/agreement-fold.svg) | Mirrored folds interlock to suggest two sides aligning. |
| Outcome Mark | ![Outcome Mark](./logo-concepts/outcome-mark.svg) | Angular mark resolves into a solid corner block (recorded outcome). |
| Dual Trace | ![Dual Trace](./logo-concepts/dual-trace.svg) | Two traces converge into a single signal line. |
| Anchor Frame | ![Anchor Frame](./logo-concepts/anchor-frame.svg) | Minimal frame with a reinforced corner. |
