# Notification UX rules

1. **Every notification includes a clear “why now.”**
   - Add a reason line that explains the timing (e.g., due date within 24 hours, due date has passed, completion confirmed).

2. **Every notification is either actionable or explicitly informational.**
   - Actionable notifications include a CTA that leads to a meaningful next step.
   - Informational notifications omit the CTA and explicitly state “No action needed.”

3. **No dead-end navigation.**
   - CTAs must link to a screen where the user can take a relevant action or review details.

4. **Avoid empty CTAs.**
   - If the user can’t do anything meaningful, remove the CTA and explain why.

5. **Use consistent voice and clarity.**
   - Keep copy concise, specific, and action-oriented.
